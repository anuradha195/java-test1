### Practical

1. Very good!
2. Very good! Note: the task was mashed together with task 1 for some reason
2. (extra) Very good! Note: to insert line break, use `\n` instead of `<br>`
3. Good! Minor fix: you're printing 42 numbers, and have a leftover comma at the end
4. Very good! The version that is commented out also has only a very slight mistake

### Notes: 
- The good style in Java suggests using `camelCase` to name your variables https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case
- Having consistent formatting, indentation, naming, and deleting unused stuff will help with understanding your own project a lot
